        <h3 class="section-title">About PTC</h3>
        <p>Pateros Technological College (PTC) is a technical-vocational school established on January 29, 1993 by virtue of Municipal Ordinance No. 93-07.
            <br> It started its operation on August 16, 1993, initially offering short term and two-year Associate in Computer Science, Computer Secretarial Science,
            <br> and Computer Technology courses. Systematrix Computer Education and Services, 
            <br>Inc. (SCESI) became the partner group of PTC through Municipal Resolution No. 64 – 95 authorizing the Municipality of Pateros to sign a Memorandum of Agreement with SCESI.

            <br>The partnership between PTC and SCESI ended in October, 1995. Keeping up with the goal to continue its technical-vocational advocacy, PTC forged another linkage,
            <br> this time with the Technological University of the Philippines (TUP). 
            <br>On September 26, 1995, PTC became the recipient of the Adopt-A-School program of TUP through another Memorandum of Agreement.
            <br> The linkage gave birth to the first four-year Bachelor of Computer Science program in the academic year 1997 – 1998. PTC also became TUP’s ally in the off-campus training of the latter’s undergraduate and graduate students.

            <br>Because of the linkage, Pateros Technological College gained its institutional footing to stand on its own. This paved the way to offer ladderized scheme programs that lead to Baccalaureate Degrees.
            <br> The Bachelor of Science in Education, Major in Information System and Minor in Mathematics was offered in SY 2006 – 2007. Then, 
            <br>the Certificate in Hotel and Restaurant Management leading to Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management and Bachelor of Science in Office Administration were offered the following school year.</p>
